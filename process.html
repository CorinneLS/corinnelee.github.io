  <h1>Process documentation</h1>
<!--     to explain your rationale for design selections
         such as moodboards, colour palettes and type studies
         related to your website, and specific explanations about
         your choices and selections  -->
    <p>For this project, I am designing my personal website.<br>
      I have break down the IA into : Home, Projects, About, Contact me, Process doc.</p>
    
    <p>
<!--      make a table??-->
      The 3 required dynamic elements are included in:<br>
      Home page: accordion <br>
      Contact page: tooltip, modal <br>
      About me: carousel slide <br>
      Footer: tooltip
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>All the pages follow the principle of disclosure and examplar as the elements are well segmented by grouping and using hues to show the different sections.</p>
    
    <h5 class="mt-4">Accessibility</h5>
    <p>All images have an alt text, the headings are strutured hierarchically. The text and background has good contrast as per the Webaim contrast checker.</p>
    
    
    <h5 class="mt-4">Home page</h5>
    <p>The home page contains general information about me and everything that is important to know about me, for instance, skills, education and experience. This is because users may not always explore the entire website and see the inner pages. As such, I have provided the necessary information that can get me hired (assuming the users are potential employers) on this page. </p> 
     
    <h5 class="mt-4">Projects page</h5>
    <p>This inner page contains all of my projects so far. I presented the projects in the form of cards and I added a hover effect on the cards following one of Nielsen's usability heuristics: visibility of system status. When users hover on the card, they can see that the card is highlighted in a purple color and the image is zoomed in. This also gives them feedback that they can click on the card to get more information about the project.</p> 
    
    <h5 class="mt-4">About me page</h5>
    <p>I included a carousel slide on top of the page that displays pictures of my country since this is an About Me page. This page contains more information about me: short introduction and my interests. My interests section is made to look more like a picture gallery. Initially, I added captions on a white background for ease of reading. However, the text is not displayed for some reasons and only the white background was showing. Hence, there are no captions. (I have only removed the white background but if you select the caption area, you can highlight the text. I believe I may have made unintended changes after addiing javascript(?).Please advise.)
    </p>
    
    <h5 class="mt-4">Contact page</h5>
    <p>I have omitted the footer in the contact page as the page itself contains the same content that would appear in the footer and since the page is not scrollable, it would be redundant to have the same content displayed twice. The rationale for using a modal after clicking on send message is that it allows users to review what they have input. In such a way, they are able to cancel or make changes before they sent the message. This follows Nielsen's heuristics of error prevention. I removed the attribute action="/action_page.php" from the form so that my website does not crash when for the purpose of this assignment</p>
  
    <div class="mt-4">
    <h1>Color palette</h1>
      The color palette is a linear gradient of #8490ff and #62bdfc. I chose this gradient color as it gives a tech feel since blue is associated with technology. This linear gradient appears on all the pages to keep them all in the same theme.
      <div class="d-flex"><p>This is the color used for the buttons and font.</p><div id="color-palette"></div></div>
      <div class="d-flex">I have used 60% opacity of the same color as background color.<div id="color-palette-2"></div></div>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="mt-4">References</h2>
    <span style="font-weight:300"><p>Pictures of the carousel are from Adobe Stock, all other pictures are my own.<br>Code references are from getbootstrap.com and w3schools.com</p></span>
